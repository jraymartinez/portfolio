**Abstract.** Diffraction in time of a particle initially confined in a box is studied under linear potential. Moshinsky’s shutter problem is generalized to include new initial conditions with linear potential, which show double temporal diffraction for each opposite-moving plane wave with occurrence of reflected wave at later times. Density profiles at transient times and later times are discussed. Twofold Moshinsky’s diffraction in time for high energy state of the particle is also analyzed. Classical limit as box width L tends to zero is illustrated.
