## INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there has been a growth of large volume of text data from a variety of sources. This explosion of amount of text data led to the problem of information overload. The generation today called ‘Net generation’ learns through multitasking, performing activities simultaneously, and has short attention span. ‘Net generation’ can perform more tasks simultaneously and shift their attentions quickly from one to another, but would probably be overwhelmed if they are asked to read a long report. Thus, more educators motivate them to engage in the learning content by supplying shorter contents in the curricula [[1](#ref1)]. To alleviate information overload and considering the characteristic of the ‘Net generation’, the need for automatic text summarization is deemed necessary. 

One tool for text summarization is Python package sumy [[2](#ref2)]. It has three most notably used models namely LSA (latent semantic analysis), LexRank and Luhn. LSA is an unsupervised method of summarization that combines term frequency techniques with singular value decomposition to summarize texts. Also an unsupervised approach, LexRank is a graphical based text summarizer inspired by algorithms PageRank. Meanwhile, Luhn is a naive approach based on TF-IDF. It scores sentences based on frequency of the most important words and also assigns higher weights to sentences occurring near the beginning of a document [[3](#ref3)]. In this study, we investigate and evaluate the application of sumy models on the extractive summarization task using news articles and show that the results obtained with LSA are competitive with other two algorithms developed. 

Furthermore, utilizing the sumy extractive summarization techniques, we build and implement a web application on Heroku that mainly functions as text summarizer.

## EXPERIMENTS

### DATA DESCRIPTION
The dataset is approximately 2225 documents from the BBC
news website and represented into five topical areas such
as business, entertainment, politics, sport, and technology
[[4](#ref4)]. This dataset for extractive text summarization has 510
business news articles of BBC from 2004 to 2005. For each
article, one summary are provided in the Summaries folder.
In this study, the first 100 pairs of business news articles
and its correponding reference summaries were manually
selected and used. The extractive summary articles will be
used as reference summaries (gold standard) for evaluating
the system summaries using ROUGE. 

### METHODOLOGY
!['Algorithm 1']({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/iamsam_algo.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"} 

We applied the three sumy methods in the sampled business news articles. All these algorithms extract six sentences from each article in order to compose the summary. We performed an experimental comparison with three extractive summarization techniques. The performance of each summarization technique was evaluated by using variants of the ROUGE measure [[5](#ref5)]. This performance metrics is a method based on Ngram statistics and found to be highly correlated with human evaluations [[6](#ref6)]. Concretely, Rouge-N with unigrams and bigrams (Rouge1 and Rouge-2) and Rouge-L. Each Rouge has corresponding F1, precision, recall scores. First, the value of the evaluation measure was calculated for each of the article. Next, we took average of those scores to arrive at a consolidated Recall and F1 scores for each Rouge. Algorithm 1 shows the pesudo-code of the implementation of the method in this study.


## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We evaluate the four summarization techniques on a single-document summarization task using 100 news articles from business section of BBC dataset. For this task to have a meaningful evaluation, we report ROUGE Recall as standard evaluation and take output length into account [[7](#ref7)]. For each article, each summarizer generate a six-sentences summary. The corresponding 100 human-created reference summaries are provided by BBC and used in the evaluation process. We compare the performance of the three different summarizing techniques with each other. 

Table 1 shows the results obtained on this data set of 100 news articles, including the results for LSA, and the results of the other two sumy summarizers in the single document summarization task. LSA summarization technique succeeds in summarization task on news articles followed by sumy-LexRank then sumy-Luhn.

Figure 1 visualizes the comparison of models using Rouge Recall as performance metrics. As shown, LSA has the best performance in extractive summarization task on business news articles.

## IMPLEMENTED SYSTEM
In this section, we presented the overall architecture to implement the system and discussed the major system features. 

### SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The overall architecture of web application for single document summarization based on news components using sumy models LSA,
Luhn and LexRank is shown in Figure 2. The three main phases include the back-end, front-end, and deployment. To create a web application, we utilized
Flask which is a micro web framework written in Python. For
layout to look good, we styled it with Boostrap. Finally, we
deployed the models on Heroku. Figure 3 presented visually
the detailed diagram of system features.

### SYSTEM FEATURES
I AM SAM web app alleviates information overload by distilling important information using machine learning algorithms.
It is an assistant that helps the users manage time by providing text summary in seconds. In this project, we focus on
plain text and URL as inputs. More specifically, we consider
the following features:

!['System features']({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/iamsam_fig3.png)
Figure 3: System Features.

#### Target Length 
Target length is the number of sentences in the text summary. This feature lets the user input
the prefer length of summary in terms of number of sentences
in the output.

#### Inputs
There are two possible inputs: plain text articles or URL that contains the text articles. Figure 3 visualizes
the diagam flow for these two options.

#### Check Mode
Feature ‘check mode’ gives the user a
choice to put up a reference summary. There is a ON and
OFF toggle for this feature. It provides the user to check
how good the provided summaries with respect to the reference summaries. This also shows the calculated Rouges (F1,
precision, recall) scores for each model text summary.

#### Best Summary Generator 
Once the check mode is ON,
the system compares the summary output of each algorithm
and output the best model based on Rouge Recall metric

## CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
We presented Python package sumy implementation of LSA (latent semantic analysis) outperforming the other models such as LexRank and Luhn in extractive summarization task using BBC business news articles. Furthermore, we implemented an automatic text summarization system called I AM SAM through Heroku that has capability to summarize news article from a URL or plain text utilizing the three sumy extractive summarization techniques.

As future work, we plan to extend the averaging algorithm to all articles in business news articles folder which has a total of 510 articles. In addition, we will explore other news articles such as entertainment, politics, sport, and technology.
